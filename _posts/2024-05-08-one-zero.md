Choice is a boy with macular degeneration. One day whilst playing a video game he gets sucked into his PC! He needs to come out before entirely loses his eye sight!

Entirely made by me.
(Your screen will turn darker as time passes, full screen recommended) 

What is macular gegeneration?
Macular degeneration causes loss in the centre of the field of vision. In dry macular degeneration, the centre of the retina deteriorates.
